/**
 * Protocol defining communication between Settings Sync Data Provider and a syncable setting.

 * Its responsibilities are:
 *   * provide implementation for getting and updating the setting's value,
 *   * fine-tune Sync behavior for the setting,
 *   * track changes to setting's value and notify delegate accordingly.
